This is a basic article about how can I imagine 
the next generation of pure html animation sytem.

So first of all I will make a animation tag,
which content a many attributes 
like a class in a Tailwind

<code class="text-emerald-500">
&lt;animation 
  duration-800
  delay-50
  animation-(make-alpha)
  rule-dont-write-space
&#47;&gt;
</code>

That attributes write down the full behavior 
of that animation works 

Maybemy first test is create animated UI
this way.

So this attributes can be added to any 
elements, but need to be tested it is 
working or not.

So my idea I written there.

<code class="text-emerald-500">
  &lt;movie-title 
    duration-1000
    delay-according-scroll
    theme-bad-as-title-sequence
  &#47;&gt;

    <span class="text-yellow-300">Action on Dark Lake</span>

            <span class="text-yellow-300">play by</span>

        <span class="text-yellow-300">Chuck Norris</span>
      
  &lt;movie-title&gt;
</code>

Why I like this way to made some new idea
because I don't afraid of think out of box.

Plus the PURE - HTML is much more 
cleaner than use of some framework

So this blockbusterJS is just a couple of 
good custom tag.

I will see, how fare I can going with this stuff.
I hate a too complex solution for a basic 
problem.

If some animation will be complex as can be,
then we can use some director template, may be.
