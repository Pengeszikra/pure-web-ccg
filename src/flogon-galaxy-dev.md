# Let's mOving _forward_
## The real problem is:
I cannot able to moving forward my next gama and I was stack to a 
`laderboard` problem on Reddis
_Devvit_

This system us so exiting, even I can implement a real game 

A this point I need to make a Quick decision, I try to finish my 
previous game with a score board or I moving forward, 
with the fancy Flogon Galaxy ?

## Marker is great for organize my tought. 
Even I can use it for a `blogpost dev environment`
That is the question.
