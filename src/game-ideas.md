## Login System With Markdown Editor

How much fun if the login system is a markdown editor,
until you fulfill the right code block, you can't login
to the game.

You can use `Marker` on minimal functionality or even worst.

> Wors idea is the `B A D - M A R K E R` which is editor, but turn to something else. Maybe insert a sarcastic or enigmatic remark to your code.

If try to change the skin to ligth then it is change a darker skin and everything will be much more scary. Even sometimes you can play minigame inside in some block.

The possibilities near endless.

> Maybe it is a evil paralell editor ( scary thing is open AI answer )
