A first impression of `devvit` is really worst, maybe I spend too much time to use a `pure HTML` development before, and that is really don't fit to there. Or just need to figure out how can I compile my code to this system.

Then the next question is a  `APP` tabletop idea how can work. So I too few times, a too many question left, but I feel the `flow` at least.

## Wrong with MarkerEditor
