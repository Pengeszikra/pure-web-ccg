## Rework a new repo from a Reddit App One

I have so many bad impression from a reddit community. I think I am not so popular
as I can dreamed, my post are deleted. But the Flogon Galaxy Trailer at least
collect a 13 like a sort time in r/aiVideo before that is deleted.
r/indiegames even delete my questions.
I think my chanche to earn some score on that hackhaton is so minimal because 
I cant able to implement a high score list.

In the AWS hackhaton I don't fall into this trap. To show my concept is working 
the created game need to be polished to show the AI helped content can be 
controlled enough to able to tell my story to audiance. Without this wow factor
I don't have a chanche to win.

## AWS Build Challenge Focus Point
- AWS Service using
- Amazon Q useing
- A fine game interaction experience
- Stronger Story Telling vs Throw to Match
